##  Katherine Blaine's Github Practice

# Notes:
- git init does not follow with file name
- One time use only!
- Sequence = git init, git add *file name*, git commit -m "commit title"

# Questions:
- git diff command?

# Answer:
- Git diff evaluated the difference between the latest commit and the current version of the file. It will not provide any feedback if the most recent commit is the same as the current version of the file.

This is the same with git status. Working tree will be clean if the most recent commit is the same as the current version of the file.
